# The goal and the path

I can choose one of many paths. Most are easy but they give me no joy. The one I like is dead opposite and I don't know why. It just always is that way. Sometimes, I am just a dice and the choice is not mine. But that is not always the case. One only thinks that way. I see a beautiful stretch ahead of me but it does not last long. Yet, a few seconds of happiness is better than none. Now there is so much of chaos and I'm overwhelmed. I toil through it for some time and it is now past. This path is better as I see things not many others see. The restlessness of people and a race to nowhere. Finally, when I see the goal from afar, I realize that I don't want to stop. So, I pause.
