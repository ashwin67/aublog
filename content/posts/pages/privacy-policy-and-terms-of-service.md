# Privacy Policy And Terms of Service

### Website Visitors

Like most blogs, this blog collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. This blog’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use it. From time to time, the blog may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. This blog also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. It does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to this blog choose to interact in ways that require this blog to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that the blog gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who use the comments box to provide a username and email address. In each case, the blog collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the blog. The blog does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

### Aggregated Statistics

The blog may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, the blog may reveal how many hits a particular page got, or say which posts are most popular based on checks from `statpress plugin`, a plugin for WordPress installations to check for statistics. However, the blog does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

The blog does not disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anybody as it is a one-author blog. The blog will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. The blog discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when the blog believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the blog, third parties, or the public at large. The blog takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. The blog does not need cookies to operate. 

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, the blog may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in the blog’s sole discretion. The blog encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
