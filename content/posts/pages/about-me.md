# About Me

I, the word itself causes so many questions. About me? If only I could be so sure of that. The beliefs I had yesterday change tomorrow. The instinctive actions conflict with what I think are rational actions. If only I could have defined "about-me".

In any case, looking retrospectively, I studied electronics and communication engineering, became a software engineer, got bored of it, quit and started an environmental company, quit that too when life became too tough and went back to being an electronics engineer. That is where I am now.

The old ideals had at one point given way to skepticism. But ideals do not die that easily.
