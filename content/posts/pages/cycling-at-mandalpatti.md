# Cycling at Mandalpatti

\--------

### April 12th 2009, Mandalpatti

Mandalpatti located 30 km from Madikeri is one of those less travelled perfect place for the casual adventurist. Being located in coorg, temperatures are pretty much on the lower side. So, cycling all day in the hilly terrain is do-able. Most important thing to remember here is, you wont find ANY shops in a 20 km radius from the peak. So, pack as much food as you require when cycling here. And where to arrange bicycles? I am not sure about that since we carried our own bicycles from Mysore.  
Personally this is my best adventure till date which involved:

  1. Loading and unloading the bicycles on top of a bus ourselves.
  2. The cycling journey itself.
  3. Cycling in the night with visibility not more than 20 meters.
  4. Hitch hiking! (Totally unexpected)
  5. Sleeping in a bus-stand bench all night! (Amazing one :) )
