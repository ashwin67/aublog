# Trekking

One more hobby to pass time. There is no definite agenda in this matter. Never plan in detail. When the time comes, I just start towards some good hill. Till now: 

  * Kumara Parvatha - 2 times
  * Thirunelli - 10 or more times
  * Kodachadri
  * Kemmannugundi/Hebbe Falls - 2 times
  * Skandagiri, Saavandurga, Shivaganga
  * Kunti Betta, Tonnur Kere, Chamundi Hills, Gopalswamy Betta
After listing out the places, I realize now that I haven't done much trekking. And life now seems short!
