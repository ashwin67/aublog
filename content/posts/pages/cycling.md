# Cycling

Current Bike: RockRider 5.2 bought at [Decathlon](http://decathlon.in) on September 14th 2010. Memorable tours include: 

  * Bangalore - Manchanabele Reservoir
  * Mysore - Kunti Betta
  * Thirunelly - Kannur
The bike itself though has done better: 
  * Bangalore - Devanahalli (courtesy Sunil)
  * Tour of Nilgiris (Courtesy Raghavendra)
I prefer using my bicycle for commuting to office. The sun, the dust and the traffic conspire against me though. At least 50% of the days, I use my bicycle. My earlier bicycle was a normal 25kg Hercules. In spite of the weight, it served me well. Memorable trips include: 
  * Bangalore - Mysore - 2 times
  * Bangalore - Hosur
  * Madikeri - Mandalpatti
  * Mysore - Mahadevpura
  * Mysore - Kunti Betta
  * Mysore - Kaveri Trail
  * Numerous locales around Mysore such as Varuna canal, KRS, Srirangapatna and Chamundi Hills
  * Sunday morning cycling at Bangalore around Nice Road and around Vidhana Soudha
I wish I could do more..
