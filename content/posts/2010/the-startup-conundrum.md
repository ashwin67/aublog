# The Startup Conundrum

One of my entrepreneur friends, Vinay once told me "Earlier, your boss used to screw you. Now when you are an entrepreneur, the whole world wants to screw you." The customer wants to buy at a cheaper price than you can manufacture. The government wants to stack all its policies against you. The investor wants all the returns in the world. So what do you do? Right now, all I know is to just stay on course and see through the journey. ![the company](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TuZ4YYywUxo/S5Je9h5aNnI/AAAAAAAAByA/94yoa0fgbt8/s800/the-company.jpg)
