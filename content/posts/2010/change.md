# Change

![2009 2010 change](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TuZ4YYywUxo/Szwrf2zGgFI/AAAAAAAABf4/m5QjUGU7cQM/s800/year%20meter.jpg)

Wish you a year of _change_ and a great decade ahead!

Replace _change_ with _happiness_. In my experience, change means happiness. Some of the major changes I did to me in the past 2 years:

  * Planted more than 500 trees with the help of a lot of well-wishers (and had to stop doing this too!).
  * Started a business with 2 friends and failed in that (learnt a lot of lessons in the process).
  * Started another business with same friends and seeing a lot of hope in this (understood the importance of persistence).
  * Started networking with people (something in which I was really bad at).
  * Started teaching occasionally at a school to 7th standard kids (learning that education systems really need reforms).
  * Started blogging.

Each one of them has been a life changing experience. Each one of them was a really tough thing to start. Change is always like that. I hope this year would bring more such changes; to me and to you. I'd really want more people to come out of their comfort levels and make a change to themselves and in the process, to the world too.

**[Anil](#111 "2010-01-01 23:41:38"):** Hope is a good thing, may be the best of things and a good thing never dies :)

**[G V Krishnan](#112 "2010-01-02 06:12:36"):** Well said, Anil. 'Hope','life' and 'change' are interrelated. I guess the driving force for Ashwin's life-altering changes is hope.

**[Ashwini](#113 "2010-01-09 21:21:00"):** Good Repely sir(@g v krishnan)....That driving force should be there to come up with some innovative ideas....We will wish him all success throughout his life....
