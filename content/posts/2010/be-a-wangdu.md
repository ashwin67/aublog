# Be a Wangdu!

* [Rajesh Hanbal](http://rajesh-hanbal.blogspot.com/) used to work at a reputed software firm in Bangalore. He has quit his job and is dedicated towards preparations for the Indian Administrative Service.
  * [Ashwin Krishna](http://www.ashwinkrishna.info) also used to work at a software firm in Bangalore. He has quit to achieve his dreams. His aim is to create a world-class university.
  * [Vinay Parameswarappa](http://www.royalmysorewalks.com/), another ex-software engineer conducts walk tours in Mysore and gives you an experience of true places which are not in any map.
  * Rakshit plans to quit his software job and get into music production.
  * Prashanth is director at an [internet solution company](http://informedia.co.in/).
  * Justin is an American who is passionate about Mysore and works hard to make civic problems known.
  * Sourabh, again an ex-software engineer runs a [book club and is into event management](http://www.vayam.in/).
  * Suraj and Anil and I run a company into renewable energy power plants (1).

I had written about [Mysore Santhe in my last post](/blog/2010/spread-that-idea). That is where I met many of the people I mentioned now. We had many more people like GV Krishnan (2), Krishnavattam, Bapu Sathyanarayana, ER Ramachandran and Javeed Nayeem who write for the print media and Anantaramaiah who runs a school in Mysore.

I guess you liked [Phunsuk Wangdu](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phunsuk-Wangdu-Aamir-Khan/243793506128) on screen. Mysore Santhe is a place to meet such Wangdus. And probably get inspired enough to become a Wangdu yourself.

  1. Added this line after comments from readers
  2. It was G V Krishnan who initiated this idea of Mysore Santhe

You will meet him in the next meet. Also, tell as many people as possible to attend. It is as much yours as it is ours :)
