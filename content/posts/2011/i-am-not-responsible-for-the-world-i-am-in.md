# I am not responsible for the world I am in..

As evil as it may seem to some, I now believe in that statement. It does not mean that I would put an atom bomb or something on a city. It just means that I don't have to feel guilty for not sacrificing my life for the good of others in this world. I once believed that working for 'someone else (like a large company)' was not good for me. I would often ask 'What am I doing with my life wasting all my energy for the sake of another company?'. I'd think 'Couldn't I do something useful and improve this world rather than just doing work which someone else tells me to do?'. Then, I tried to live my dreams, started a company with friends and did some things I believed were good for this world. The challenges in doing good are immensely large and I have already written a lot about this in those entrepreneurial days. It was not easy. Realism overcame my idealism. I stopped, reset myself and went back to where I was working before. I felt guilty for a long time for quitting something which I thought was the only right thing. But this served as a lesson and now I have realized. There is only one thing which I have control on. It is, the work I do and I will do it well. I do not have any control on its result. If the world is doomed for disaster because of humans' utter disregard for its environment, so be it. I will plant a few trees though, every year, not to prevent the earth from doom but just because I feel it is right to do so. If my country is sinking in corruption, then so be it. I will still not pay any bribes though, not to uplift my country but just because it would hurt my conscience. And with this realization of reality, I now love my work as well. All I now have to think is whether I am enjoying the work I do and the answer is 'Yes'.Â Since I have no need to think about the usefulness of my work to this world, I am relieved of a great burden. In the end, 

> The words are not good for the secret meaning, everything always becomes a bit different, as soon as it is put into words, gets distorted a bit, a bit silly.... what is one man's treasure and wisdom always sounds like foolishness to another person.

**[Ashwini](#170 "2011-05-30 10:01:40"):** Really good blog Ashwini.....I like the ending.... Yes we have to love what we do...Our life is like a small ant on an Big elephant, we can only travel on the surface of the elephant but the final destiny or our final goal decided by the elephant itself...:)... So even also left thinking about what is right what is wrong...Just doing what I feel happy and which is not affecting others....

**[Suraj Rampure](#171 "2011-05-30 10:39:19"):** That is only to rationalize oneself my boy. Deep down we all know that we are collectively responsible for the end result. History is evident that one man was responsible for every great movement. Had that one man thought the way you do here, you very well know we would not be reaping the benefits of it today.

**[ashwin-upadhyaya](#172 "2011-05-30 20:37:45"):** @Ashwini: Thanks :) @Suraj: I know what you mean deep down my boy :) But, History is never so evident as you think it might be. History is just a view of certain historians. So, if you take one historian's view, you might think that Gandhi's first and foremost aim from the beginning was to make India independent. However, another historian would tell you that he was just a social reformer who just happened to lead the collective will of a nation at the right time. History is never so evident. Similarly, one historian would say that Chengiz khan set out from the outset to rule half the world. Another would give a different perspective, saying that it was just a series of fortunate events that turned him from a murderer to a ruler of the world. History again is not so evident. My point in the blog however was not about 'not having an ambitious aim of changing the world'. It is just about 'not feeling guilty for not having one'.

**[kavya](#173 "2011-06-12 16:11:42"):** YOur article is like a breath of fresh air. This is one of the very few articles which I have ever read in my life which I can completely co-relate to. If somebody would be not-so-guilty to begin with and would knew how they fit in as a speck in a larger frame of things, probably this article will make them question - common! who would think so !.. But if a person has been in the guilt trodden path and then in the process of coming out of it he/she start seeing things from all together a different perspective.. A very good article indeed...
