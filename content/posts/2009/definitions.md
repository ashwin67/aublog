# Definitions

What do you want to become when you grow up?

When I was 10 years, my reply was simple; Engineer. When you are a child, it always feels good to give the "right" answer. When being "right" means being acceptable by the people around you, the "right" answers are always easy.

5 years later, the reply was a slight modification; Electronics Engineer. At this point, I had told so many people that I'd be an engineer that the pressure to become one was just too much. Also, I was "good" at school. When being "good" means being on the right path to assured money and success, "good" is easy to achieve.

Another 5 years later, a further modification; Software Engineer. At this stage, this seemed to be like the only thing I could ever be. If I was not this, it would seem like I had wasted my life. At least, that is what people told me. It was the "goal" of all the education I had. When "goal" is a constant derived from a few set of parameters, "goal" is the easiest mathematical problem of life.

The greatest challenge in life is to redefine these simple looking words.

**[Vishwas Krishna](#58 "2009-07-16 21:04:58"):** Not bad, you had knowledge about something called engineering while in school. My only goal while in school, was to pass, especially, when in high school, where I was not at all a "good" student! I decided to become a chartered accountant only after I passed tenth!

**[Ashwini](#59 "2009-07-26 00:12:54"):** Really Nice one Ashwin....definitions and dreams changes according to the time,situation,trend and on money values... In early child hood days I dreamed about getting married(in those days I really dont know what is marriage, and I was thinking it is just an good occasion where u can dress up yourself with heavy jewelries,new cloths and with rich hairstyle,and all relatives will come to that occation) In middle school's days I used think about becoming a teacher, In highschool days about a research scholor , In PUC I was dreaming to became a "Doctor"...Finally I end up as an Engineer,Which I never dreamed a single day about it on those 19 years my life....
