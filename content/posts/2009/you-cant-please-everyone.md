# You can't please everyone

Everyone praises a country's soldiers. But very few would send their sons to the army. It is too risky! Everyone wants the country's political system to change and hope that good people join politics. But very few consent their sons and daughters to enter politics. It is a corrupt place you know. Every one wants their children to be like Narayan Murthy. But very few would like their children to stay away from a regular job.

Very few consent their children to take the less taken path. So, if you have to do something different than a regular job, hurting a few sentiments somewhere is inevitable. You can only try to make the pain a little lesser. No point trying to eat the cake and have it too.

**[somana](#68 "2009-08-12 03:08:56"):** ... u know wat.. i was truly disappointed, I was filling up to apply for IAF, and apparently to join IAF u need to be unmarried !!

**[ashwin](#69 "2009-08-12 09:11:43"):** oh! that is really unfortunate.. What does a marriage have to do with iaf?!! I hope they have a really strong reason for this. For plain sight, it just looks absurd.

**[Ashwini](#70 "2009-08-16 12:42:53"):** ...Yup U r right Ashwin... Every parents dream the same....they dont want their children go out of this regular stream and do something different....I think they are scared about the future ....coz they think more about future rather than present....
