# Weepers

What is the first impression you would get of a person who introduces himself with a sorrow tale of his? No matter whether it is a real emotion or not, it definitely creates some amount of skepticism about his authenticity. Yet, you find so many weepers out there. They exist in all different forms, as businessmen who say they were cheated, as Nigerian mails and more. Beware of all of these weepers! A truly authentic person would never talk about his miseries. He would just treat them as mistakes from which he should learn.
