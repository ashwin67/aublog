# Meet more people

There is a major problem with techie-turned-businessmen. Almost all the techies I know (including myself in the past) typically are people-shy. I think it is because we spend day in and day out with computers; coding, debugging, testing, blogging, facebook, orkut and more. I got trained in watching computers for 30 months and it has definitely taken its toll. When I decided that I would quit software and do business and that too, a non-internet-based one, I didn't expect that business is all about meeting varied types of people, sometimes all day.

The change has not been easy. More than a year passed and I am still working hard on getting used to meeting people. However, now I can easily say that the more people you meet in a day, the more successful you are in your business. Yesterday, I met a group of 30 people at some place and one of them turned out to be a potential customer. I went to some function and again found a few potential customers. Lots of such experiences are acting as an affirmation of my new found philosophy of showing up in front of people.

And it is not just about meeting people in real. Twitter and online communities too are useful in this direction. My friend seems to know so many VCs and angel investors all via these media. I haven't yet completely found the knack of showing up at these places but I am learning this now.

May be I am just talking about something which is really very obvious and doesn't need all this writeup. However, if it is not already obvious to you, then you need to think about it seriously.
