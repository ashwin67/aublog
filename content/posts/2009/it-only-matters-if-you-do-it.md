# It only matters if you do it

It has been 3 weeks since I last blogged. The first 2 or 3 days it didn't feel anything. The next 5 to 6 days, it was like "tonight, I will write" and it somehow never happened. And after the first 10 days had passed, there was sort of a pressure that I had to write something really super to make up for all the absence. But anything I could think of was not good enough for me.

However, the entrepreneurial spirit inside me kicked in today.

“The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It's as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer.”  (Nolan Bushnell)

There is no point in saying, "I'll do it" a hundred times. All that matters is whether you really do it or not.
