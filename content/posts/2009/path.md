# Path

Two people, x and y decide they want to reach the top of the hill in front of them. x drives a car and reaches in an hour while y climbs by foot and takes five hours. Did time really matter to y as much as choice? If he wanted, y could have taken the easier path as well. It is the path that really matters, not the goal. The goal is nothing but a natural result.
