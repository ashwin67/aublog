# Product Release

Some things have to be learned the hard way. Say, you want to launch a new product. For example, shoes. What would it take to introduce a shoe into the market? Theoretically, you would just have to find lace suppliers, leather suppliers, thread suppliers, hard sole suppliers and a few workers to stitch the shoe. When you actually start looking for the suppliers, comes the surprise. The lace supplier would be dealing in thousands only. The leather supplier would not take an order if the quantity is less than a truck load. Workers in your state wouldn't have the knowledge to make leather shoes, they may be proficient in rubber boots probably. The issues never end. There is no problem which does not have a solution. Most can be solved with either money or time. Larger organizations have money on their side while a small startup has time on its side. The only problem arises when problems are under-estimated.
