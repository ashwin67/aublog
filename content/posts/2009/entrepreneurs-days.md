# Entrepreneur's days

Is this how every entrepreneur's days look like? Full of ups and downs.

![Entrepreneurs Days Graph](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TuZ4YYywUxo/SvV_9xmVkkI/AAAAAAAABcI/oiqALhqHU-w/s800/entrepreneurs-days.JPG) Is this emotional roller coaster really worth it? My feeling is that, it is worth if you are after the journey and not necessarily the destination.
