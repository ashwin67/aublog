# Questions I don't have an answer now

I am writing this post so that I can come back 5 years later and see if I have found the answers. Its just a list of questions.

  1. Is there really something called a breakthrough event in business or is it just a series of incremental improvements?
  2. Does a startup become successful only if we keep fighting against all odds? Or, is it better to stop the battle, prepare with better arms and then come back? I remember the quote by Abraham Lincoln: "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe". The catch however is that, in the case of a startup, you don't even know what to chop until you have started. 
  3. How much of a toll does starting your own company take on your family?
  4. Once you start a company, you start to live in a different world. You start being more optimistic about things. You start living on hope. A hope that, even if something fails, that will lead to something even better. Does this feeling exist only during the startup phase? Or does it the change you forever?
