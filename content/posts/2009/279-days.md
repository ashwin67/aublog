# 279 days

Strange! I wrote the previous post about writing and since then, haven't written. And then I read this manifesto by Chris Guillebeau: [279 days to overnight success](http://chrisguillebeau.com/3x5/files/2009/04/279days.pdf). If you haven't already read about [Chris](http://chrisguillebeau.com), I think you should read now. He is a world traveller and has visited 107 out of  the 197 countries. His goal: To visit every country in the world by April 7, 2013!!

I think, the most important points he mentions regarding writing a blog (In fact, applicable to many other activities too) :

  * Decide on a clear publishing schedule
  * Create a Compelling Story and Be Remarkable
  * Clearly Answer the “Reason Why”

If a normal person would say the things that are said in this book, I would be slightly skeptical whether it would be possible. But from a person, who has visited 107 countries at the age of 31, it is completely believable.
