# Took a break

I just did a reboot by not blogging for 3 weeks and it feels fresh. Extrapolating this to other forms of communication, does it help if

  * you stay away from the mobile phone for a day?
  * you stay away from the Internet for a couple of days?
  * you refrain from talking entirely for a day? (A bit extreme may be)

Anyway, I think there is some benefit at least to the creative section of the mind because of doing this. Probably that is why, poets and artists prefer solitude.
