# The railway ticket queue

Thought of an interesting analogy while talking to my friend.

Getting into a relatively new business is like the formation stages of a queue in front of railway ticket counter (in India). When a ticket counter opens, people rush to be the first person at the queue. The ones who are smartest (by guessing which is the first to open) always have an eye on the counter even when it is closed. Just when it is about to open, they make the run for it. Most don't make it to the front, yet there is fierce competition. Example: IT industry in the 1980s, Renewable energy now.

Getting into an existing business is like joining the existing queues. You can still move forward but the excitement is missing. Example: IT industry now, Renewable energy 10 years from now.
