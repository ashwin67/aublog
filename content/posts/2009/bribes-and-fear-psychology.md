# Bribes and Fear Psychology

How does a government employee manage to extract bribe from you? Experiences in the past one week have clearly showed me that it is by installing fear. Example this conversation: Government Employee: "Pay Rs.100"Â  (That is how openly they ask for bribes) I: "Why?" Government Employee: "Everyone pays it. You will have to pay it" (Now that is the first trick. Since most people fear acting in a way different to how everyone acts, fear sets in) I: "If everyone pays, why should I?" Government Employee: "Well. Don't pay. You will know the consequences later." (The second trick: Direct threatening) I: "Well, I don't mind the consequence" Government Employee (To a person sitting next on the adjacent table): "He doesn't know how it works" (A last ditch effort to extract money) My hypothesis for the time being is: "A weak person bribes".
