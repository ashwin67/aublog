# Ideas and Happiness

Why do I like writing? Because the writing process forces me to generate new ideas, refine those ideas and put those ideas in understandable format.

Why do I like networking with people? Because I can discuss ideas, obtain feedback on those ideas and convert at least some of those ideas into action.

Why do I love teaching at schools? Because school kids ask questions which have a totally different and special perspective which fuels my creativity further.

Why do I love working at our company? It is a [huge laboratory](http://sivers.org/laboratory) where we test so many ideas and get the best possible feedback on those ideas.

Do you get bored sometimes? If yes, I think you should start working on an idea.

“If you observe a really happy man you will find him building a boat, writing a symphony, educating his son, or looking for dinosaur eggs in the Gobi Desert.” - Australian psychiatrist W. Béran Wolfe
