# Story

We all love stories. [Kurt Vonnegut explained this beautifully (as written by Derek Sivers)](http://sivers.org/drama).

> People have been hearing fantastic stories since time began. The problem is, they think life is supposed to be like the stories.

Isn't it then obvious why we are always impressed by brands which have a story. The Infosys brand has a story. The Reliance brand has a story. The fisherman's son who becomes president of India captures our attention. A black president of the US impresses us even more.

This becomes all the more important when you are marketing or selling something. If your product doesn't have a story, you are just explaining the product. People do not want explanations. People want stories. In a world where everyone is marketing one or the other thing, the ones with a story win. The employee with an average technical knowledge but with a great story telling capacity gets promoted faster. The product with the same features as its competition but with great looks sells more.

If you don't have a story yet, then it's time you create one.

**[vishwas krishna](#82 "2009-09-19 18:26:27"):** You see, every story has a beginning and an end. And in the end, usually, everyone lives happily, forever. Probably, this thing of living happily appeals to everyone, which isn't the case with real life.
