# Place you live and success

Does the place you live in determine your success? I never gave it a thought earlier but now I feel it might be worth thinking. Here's what I think may be missing in a smaller city like Mysore (where I live in):

  1. Not many entrepreneurs here. The Internet is the only means to meet people.
  2. Limited kinds of businesses here. Its mostly traditional businesses where most people are unwilling to try new things. As a result, low chances to try out new things.
  3. Very very low Internet penetration. So, any online business won't work here, at least as of now.
  4. People don't spend as much as they do in large cities.

Although I may be generalizing on some things here, the fact is that you get less opportunities to explore and less people to interact with in smaller cities. And that exactly is what an entrepreneur needs and that exactly is what I miss these days. I require some action and my city, known as a retired person's paradise doesn't really provide opportunity for action.

And a big city has other baggage!

**[ashwin](#51 "2009-06-21 21:26:16"):** Yes, bigger cities have other baggages. That was one of the reasons for me to move out of the big city I was in. Maybe my thoughts above are just another case of the grass looking green on the other side.

**[vinay](#52 "2009-06-22 01:15:02"):** I think you are making a generalization here.. guess it depends on the field you are looking at. Yes big cities come in with all tht u mentioned but the also have the downfalls. Its about making the best of what we have, ain't tht the thing with start ups :) correct me if i'm wrong :)

**[ashwin](#53 "2009-06-22 07:48:33"):** Yes, I think I made a generalization here. It sure depends on the field. I may have interpolated my own experiences to every other field. :) As far as the second point you mention i.e. **making the best of what we have**. I feel restricting ourselves to a particular location when we can make use of a nearby larger city may not be the best utilization of opportunity. I think your point here would hold good in case of government regulations or something like that, where we are not in a position to change things easily.

**[GVK](#54 "2009-06-22 09:32:19"):** Maybe Mysore can be made to tick, if we get in place urban socio-economic infrastructure that has long been in the pipeline. If the city can be made easily commutable, it might add to quality of life , and you could get people moving to Mysore,from some far-flung Bangalore suburbs, such as Khammnabahalli. My reference is to doubling of rail-track from bangalore, and opening the Mysore airport. And . of course, the completion of Expressway, about which no one seems even talking. NICE Corridor has been envisaged not just as a high-speed road, but as a series of commuter townships, located strategiclly all along the Expressway.
