# Not enough skills?

The question is: Whether to perfect the skills you have and then apply them on a task? Or whether to apply whatever half-baked skills you have on a task and then improvise the skills?

This question typically arises when starting a business. You don't have much idea about selling that gadget you have made. You also don't have the confidence whether the gadget is of top quality or not. So, do you start selling now? Or do you attain more perfection and then start selling?

Although I may be considered wrong by some, I think you should start with that imperfect item and with that 'less than enough' skill and just start business. Improvisation can always be done later. If perfection was always the criteria, Microsoft windows wouldn't ever have existed. Remember, there was a Windows 1.0 too.

Think of it, when you first joined a company as a fresher, were you perfect? Didn't you take some time to just learn what you were supposed to do. Same goes with business.
