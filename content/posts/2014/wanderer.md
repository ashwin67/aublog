# Wanderer!

Why can't I be there again?

Where only the sun woke us up, The peaks showed us the way, The sight of people cheered us.

Where life was simple, There was happiness in the smile of an old man, There was satisfaction in the face of every traveller.

Where the road ahead was always unknown, The days were always difficult but never impossible, The goal was never bigger than the journey.

Or maybe I do not have to go anywhere Maybe it is not about the place itself. Isn't this all in the wanderer's mind?
