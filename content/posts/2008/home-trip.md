# Home-Trip!!

With no clear reason yesterday while watching Discovery channel at Mysore, I suddenly felt I had to get out of home. I just had some vague ideas which required me to travel to my former home, Bangalore. It took me 25 minutes from first thought to actually tie the lace of my shoe and in another 20 minutes, I was sitting comfortably, reading "India Today" in an empty compartment of "Tuticorin Express". Another 30 minutes and the world was at peace or rather I had dozed off until I reached Bangalore at half past nine. After 12 days off from Bangalore, the first 30 minutes of arrival yesterday re-summarized Bangalore for me. 2 or 3 ambulances passed in full speed with the rare help of BMTC bus drivers. An airplane flew right above my head at such low heights. The Auto-Rickshaws were as usual acting like mobile gas chambers. Finally, I reached home in one piece where I was welcomed back with the exotic dishes cooked by my ex-room-mates. How good it feels to be at home! Although, it is ex-home, it still is a home away from home. And what an amazing fruitful day. I got the BSNL marathon certificate which was held on 16th December 07. It showed that I had clocked a timing of 2 hrs and 32 minutes for the half-marathon. I hope I can cross out the 32 minutes this year. Later today, a research on consumables opened my eyes on the amount of profits retail business has to offer. An ice-cream at Corner house with the "last few" at Bosch closed the day for me at Bangalore. Traveling back to Mysore, so many ideas rushed past the CPU in me. The problem: I have not yet figured out where the hard disk of my brain is. I need to buy a PDA.
