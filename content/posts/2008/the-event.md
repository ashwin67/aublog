# The Event

Many days back, one of my friends commented here on livehournal: "Thats really an amazing job with ultimate satisfaction i guess". I didn't think much about job satisfaction then. I was thinking more about the resulting trees out of my work. But today her comment makes so much sense. Today, we at sapgreen planted the first 2 saplings. And by doing this, we may have created "an event to remember" for 2 special people.
