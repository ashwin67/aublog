# The perfect Pink Floyd wallpaper.

Now, Pink Floyd would have millions of fans. But not everyone would go this far. Not unless it is my friend, Vinay Raghav. This one would seem to you like some photoshop work. But it is not. Its a pure work of the camera and that is what makes the photo so interesting. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRdvj-cpI/AAAAAAAAAzU/EwAdEQ40uZk/s400/pf1.jpg) Have a look at this one. I cannot even imagine from where this photo is being taken. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRyAMUxyI/AAAAAAAAA28/tG_DiAONRVA/s400/pf2.jpg) Finally, this one. Now this is something which is straight out of an art exhibition. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRzLHkVoI/AAAAAAAAA3E/-ed_ybMUIpE/s400/pf3.jpg) @Vinay: I only wish you wrote a blog too with your photos. You'd have a lot more followers. Seriously, man.
