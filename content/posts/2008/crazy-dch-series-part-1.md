# Crazy DCH series - Part 1

An year and about 10 months back, 3 of us got this crazy idea that we should do a photo series. I am not sure who got this idea but anyway, this series went on and on at a number of locations. Unfortunately, the series ended when 2 of us quit Bosch. Finally now, I found almost all the photos and put it in one place. I find it fun to watch. This will be one photo compilation I'd love to frame and keep. Yet more photos to be posted.
