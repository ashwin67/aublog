# Realities

I am waiting for my friend, Anil to write a post on the experiences he had at Sringeri. A company I really admired from a long time, one which was admired by many others too, a winner of social responsibility awards multiple times, one which seemed to change people's lives. The same company makes money in reprehensible ways, takes advantage of the ignorance of illiterates, pushes its products on people who didn't even know they required the product. Wow!! Naxalites are always shown in bad light on the TV. However, it seems to me, at least the environment has benefitted from them. Illegal mining supposedly has completely come to a halt in the area. I'm not sure who is right, who is wrong anymore. Everything is just perception.

**[Ashwini](#24 "2008-12-23 13:58:58"):** "Naxalites" are not harming environment they are against some rules done by the so called national leaders... Only these politicians in their sayings making the people to feel bad about them.... We are not opposing the system... we ourself blind folded our eyes like Ghandhari and not ready to see the things happening around us...:) thats we are normal citizen and they are Nadxalites....

**[Anoop T S](#25 "2008-12-24 12:55:43"):** "Naxalites", so called are small group of people just want to make the public aware of the horrible issues and decisions taken by politicians on us. Inorder to stop them, they are targetting them to swipe out away from the people views. Need a deeper look!!!
