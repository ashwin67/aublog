# Word power

Have you come across this kind of a statement: "I would not say that Mr.Frank has underworld connections". What kind of picture does it give you about the person? This kind of an allusion to something by denying that it will be mentioned is known as apophasis. Shakespeare has Mark Antony say, "Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny". Although he uses the word "not", the word that remains in the minds of people is "mutiny". "not" does not have the same power as "mutiny" which is considered as a strong word. And Antony indeed gets a mutiny. Apophasis has been used to a very great extent by politicians. For example, how often do we not hear this: "I want to run an honourable campaign based on national issues and will not stoop to mentioning how my opponent is an alcoholic and a womanizer".The power of this psychological tool was demonstrated best in a 1900 experiment. Sugar was poured into small containers in front of a group of students. Then, some of the containers were labeled 'sugar' and the others were labeled 'not sodium cyanide'. Students when asked to pick a container and consume it preferred those marked as 'sugar'. This inspite of fully being aware that there was no poison at all!! Was just wondering how much marketers use this particular technique in their own ways. 2 days back, there was this marketing guy talking to me. I asked him about a particular brand of product. He says: _"That brand is number one in the country. But I do not recommend it. Let me not go into details of that one"_.

**[somana](#14 "2008-12-11 03:51:25"):** It is an great observation! The whole idea is the degree of perception, which is intrinsic to human nature. Perception is key element on which every human relationship is built upon...

**[ashwin](#15 "2008-12-11 14:25:21"):** True. And when it comes to marketing, you need to exactly tap into that element. To understand how the customer perceives what you represent and then gain his confidence.

**[Vishwas Krishna](#16 "2008-12-14 21:01:13"):** Very good article. The technique is quite effective. Politicians use this kind rhetoric very well. That sugar example was superb. Its the image of the negative word which stays in mind, which is what is intended.
