# An Obsession

Its an obsession. Its an indulgence. Its a temptation. I just can't resist the lake. And once I'm there I just can't come back. Sometimes it is the sun.. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRWOUIroI/AAAAAAAAAyU/xFL6O4L1ZLM/s400/kukk2.jpg)![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRY2tpeOI/AAAAAAAAAys/3vjP07ffEGg/s400/kukk5.jpg) Sometimes it is the bird.. ![](http://lh3.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRXIcJvxI/AAAAAAAAAyc/rgCGv3l3HY4/s400/kukk3.jpg)![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRXz5IW1I/AAAAAAAAAyk/u5g7ad3hvOA/s400/kukk4.jpg) Sometimes it is trees.. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRVN4sWnI/AAAAAAAAAyM/G5x9S2RDgjQ/s400/kukk1.jpg)![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRZoQwKWI/AAAAAAAAAy0/464IOLUEdI4/s400/kukk6.jpg) And sometimes, a cycle in the middle of nowhere... ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRatBUjtI/AAAAAAAAAy8/-X-e0YHUEhE/s400/kukk7.jpg) I am more than 100% sure this won't be my last post on Kukkarahalli kere.
