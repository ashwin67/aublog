# Googly

A few days back, I took a session on global warming to a small group of 12 year olds. The kind of questions they ask can take anyone by surprise. I never expected a young fellow to ask "What would be the future like if we keep burning fuels?". I never thought they would think so far ahead!! Many adults don't seem to think that far.
