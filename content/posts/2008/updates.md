# Updates

So many days have passed before I came back to livejournal to write. In fact, I was not away from blogging. I was just blogging [officially](http://sapgreen.blogspot.com/). So much has passed in the last few days. We formally [opened shop](http://sapgreen.blogspot.com/2008/04/after-work.html). Our website [sapgreen.com](http://www.sapgreen.com) is now up and running. We got featured in a [few papers](http://www.hindu.com/2008/04/06/stories/2008040650910200.htm). Best of all, [Deccan Herald](http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Apr52008/state2008040561141.asp) had an interesting caption. My cellphone doesn't last more that 12-14 hrs per battery charge these days. Finally, [business standard](http://www.business-standard.com/bsonline/storypage.php?leftnm=3&autono=319553) also had something to say about us. Apart from all of these, the real stuff is that trees planted through sapgreen.com is now **106**. And this is what matters to me.
