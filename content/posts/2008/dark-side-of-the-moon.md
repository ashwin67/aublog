# Dark side of the moon!!

India is a strange place. One day, its a positive sight. The next, its utter gloom. The day before yesterday, stocks plummeted so much, they hit the circuit breakers. And today!! One day, I'm making money like crazy with power stocks. The next day, I don't even have power at home. They start building an underpass which is to be completed in 3 days. And then the water pipes burst. Its the same everywhere. I am cruising on Bangalore Mysore highway at well over 100kmph and the next moment, its fumes. My brakes are literally fuming at the sight of an unmarked speed-breaker. No one ever sees the dark side of the moon. The brighter side is just too beautiful. So, who is going to light up the other side?
