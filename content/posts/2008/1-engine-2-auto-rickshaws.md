# 1 Engine, 2 Auto-Rickshaws

Now, this is something even the local people found strange!! ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TuZ4YYywUxo/SNo0IlJ7SXI/AAAAAAAAA6c/6ckI1L2tl1s/s400/Auto.jpg) The auto in the front didn't have pulling power of its own. So, the trailing auto driver was providing some of his own auto's power. All this action in the middle of Mysore's busiest, Irwin road. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_TuZ4YYywUxo/SNo0Ikl9nyI/AAAAAAAAA6k/VBoLQ1KDwMM/s400/auto2.jpg) No comments from my side :-)
