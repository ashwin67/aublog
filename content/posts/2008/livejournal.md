# Livejournal

Since I plan to blog regularly, I thought it would be best to personalize my blog. Moreover, livejournal was not allowing me to post for the past one month. As a result, I decided to purchase my own domain, personalize the whole blog with my own template and write some serious stuff :) As I had just finished setting up the [new sapgreen site](http://www.sapgreen.com/) and the [sapgreen blog](http://www.sapgreen.com/blog), setting this blog hardly took an hour. And that is including importing the entries from [livejournal](http://ashwin67.livejournal.com) to this blog. However, I faced some problems with importing the comments from there. Anyway, that is fine I guess. I am yet to find some time to fix the layout. Will do it over a week's time.
