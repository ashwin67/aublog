# The SJCE forest

JC is one of those places in Mysore which does not let you go easily. You enter the campus and then you feel like staying there forever. I guess in terms of greenery, it is second only to the Manasagangotri campus. Yet, there are a few empty patches within the campus where it still resembles a dry land. We just planted 60 trees at one such empty patch. The JSS horticulture director told us that we could plant anything we wanted and so we plan to make this section a forest complete with all sort of trees. However, the scale is immense. At least one or two thousand more trees are needed to fill up all the empty spaces. More about the planting here... <http://sapgreen.blogspot.com/2008/06/sjce-trees.html> ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRdBWTl-I/AAAAAAAAAzM/-62W2phpe4s/s400/jc_planting.jpg)(From left to right: Me, Anil, Venu and JSS Director of Horticulture, Shivashankarappa)
