# Orkut WAS good

Till a few days back, orkut was one place where I could find out what went on the lives of some of my spatially separated friends. Whenever they had something new to share, they would update their profile and I could see the updates. I just loved the feature. Now, all I find in this section from top to bottom is that 'x added Krazzy', 'y achieved the rank of sunday schooler', and more such nonsense. Its a silly place to be these days.
