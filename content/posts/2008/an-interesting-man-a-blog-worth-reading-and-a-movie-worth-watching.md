# An interesting man, A blog worth reading and A movie worth watching

![](http://media.economist.com/images/20080719/2908OB.jpg)........His own charity, though, was harder-edged. On earth a free capitalist system was the only way to enrich the poor. No safeguards were needed: an unethical enterprise would fail, “if not at first, then eventually.” -[John Templeton, investment analyst, self-made billionaire](http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11745591) Look at a chair, a chair is a chair or it is not a chair. It cannot be both according to the constraints of logic. Yet suppose I take a chair and gradually dismantle it... take a leg off, a bit of the back, half of the seat and so on. At what point exactly does it cease being a chair and start becoming a heap of wood? -[Michael Michalko's Amazon Blog](http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/A3Q2NUSNXYZYI6/ref=cm_blog_blog/103-3513713-9123045) ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRwC4fY2I/AAAAAAAAA2k/dV-oonFuU48/s288/dww.jpg)-Dances with Wolves. One of those movies which give you a different perspective towards what we think as right and what we consider wrong.
