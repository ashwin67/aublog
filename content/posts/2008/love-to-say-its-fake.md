# Love to say its fake :)

![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRnhY5e5I/AAAAAAAAA0k/PAYIFdjp0x0/s400/ch_hill_cyc.jpg) After many days, I finally had the chance to stage one of my fake rock climbing acts. This time I feel, it looks a lot more authentic with those bicycles in the background. :) We did however climb a real 40 foot rock thereafter. However ,we couldn't take photographs while climbing that.. And this is the place where we did all of this. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRiibKwgI/AAAAAAAAA0U/Njnj6fwyXck/s288/ch_hill_cyc2.jpg)![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRk261HsI/AAAAAAAAA0c/rO7N-RB236s/s288/ch_hill_cyc3.jpg) Somewhere on Chamundi hills.
