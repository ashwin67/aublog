# How I got the number in my user ID?

As I jogged with my friend yesterday at the lake, I suddenly got this thought that I would never be here jogging if I had kept my concentration intact during a fateful day of my life. I would never have been his friend and never would I be jogging in Mysore. In the 2nd week of May 2001 on a long awaited day, I started marking the answers. The subject was maths and it was the CET examination. The mind was trained to be a machine then. Even before the end of the stipulated time, I was done. As I came out of the hall with the entire 60 questions still hovering like planets around my head, an asteroid struck me with tremendous force. I suddenly became 100% sure that one of those planets was destroyed. I scrambled through my answer sheet copy and became sure that the answer was wrong. So, I was destined to not get into KREC (NITK now). And in SJCE, this 2 digit CET rank was my primary identity. Now the rank has one primary purpose. It is stuck with my gmail ID for ever.
