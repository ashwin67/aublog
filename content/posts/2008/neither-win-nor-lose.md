# Neither win nor lose

Probably, the taste of happiness is never really sweet. The greatest victory can be turned into a bitter loss. Its just a state of mind. The definition between winning and losing can become so blurred, the biggest question of whether the game is required at all arises. If the game is to be played at all, should it really be a multiplayer game. Probably solitary games are more satisfactory. Or maybe every game is solitary and its just an illusion that multiple players are involved.
