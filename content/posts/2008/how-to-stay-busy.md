# How to stay busy

Here's my list: 

  1. Buy a guitar. Then, visit [JustinGuitar.com](http://www.justinguitar.com/). With the amount of knowledge at that site, you could well become a pro.
  2. Write a blog. It hardly takes 10 minutes to setup a blog. I'd say [wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com) is the best looking blog site.
  3. Buy a cycle. Go [long distance cycling](/blog/2008/to-live).
  4. Just run. No accessories required. Just a pair of legs. For the sake of a target, you could actually [practice for a marathon](http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7U4VkUtnEzymVwUJK8pvTQ).
  5. Trek. Again, all you need is a pair of legs.
  6. Build your own website like this one. Or maybe like [this one](http://www.sapgreen.com/).
  7. Read a book like this one: [Stay hungry, Stay foolish](http://www.stayhungrybook.com/). This will give you even more ideas to make something out of your life.
  8. Start a [DIY project](http://www.instructables.com/tag/type:id/category:green/).
  9. Write code for open source projects. Maybe, for a [wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/).
  10. Buy a camera.
  11. Plant a tree and look after it. This IMO gives the most happiness of all.
  12. And the best of all. Start a company :)
And yes, from experience I can say that all of them can be done at the same time as well
