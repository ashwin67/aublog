<h1>OSS</h1>
<p>Since 2012, I have become interested in open source software. Some of the main reasons were coursera, Foss.in and my own loss of interest in the corporate engineering style. Following are some of the projects I am currently working on: </p>
<ul>
<li>An autonomous driving robot - Still under plan (machine learning based)</li>
<li>An app on Heroku - Still not planned (probably a car pool thing)</li>
<li>An android app - Still not planned ( probably for the car pool thing)</li>
</ul>
