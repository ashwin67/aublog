    Bicycle - Best means of transport in Bangalore, 2012/11/22 19:04:21

<h1>Bicycle - Best means of transport in Bangalore</h1>
<p>First, let me compare some travel times here from my experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>Distance from my home to office - 9 kms (Jayanagar to Bommanahalli via the dreaded silk board junction)</li>
<li>Travel time by bike - Average 35 minutes (Considering all kinds of shortcuts possible in a bike)</li>
<li>Travel time by car - Average 50 minutes (30 minutes in the morning but upto 1.5 hours in the evening)</li>
<li>Travel time by bus - One hour (But I like this one as I make good use of the time reading something)</li>
<li>Travel time by bicycle - Exactly 35 minutes (traffic or no traffic)</li>
</ol>
<p>However, cycling has its own set of problems but all of them have solutions. Here are some:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pollution - I had stopped cycling for a long time before I found the solution - <a href="http://www.decathlon.in//POLLUTION-MASK-NEO-MASK">An activated carbon cloth filter mask from Decathlon</a>. I have been using this for some time now and it only needs a couple of days for you to get adjusted to it (just as you would get adjusted to a seat belt or a helmet). And it does its job well. If required, buy some glasses as well.</li>
<li>Too much traffic - The distance from my home to office is 9 kms. However, I take a 9.5 kms route in the morning and a 10 kms route in the evening. These are entirely residential routes which the larger vehicles cannot take as most of these result in a road-divider or they are too narrow. In one section, I have a short 50 meter stretch that I have to push along the footpath as the road is a one way. But this keeps me away from the traffic. The advantages only available to cycles.</li>
<li>A sweaty affair - This I must admit is a problem if your office does not have a shower facility. I take an extra shirt with me to office everyday as the shower room is not well kept.</li>
<li>Crazy night traffic - Better planning helps. I start early and try to finish early from office. I either leave before 6 PM or leave after 8 PM. Also, I always carry a couple of LED lights with me.</li>
<li>Office laptop/Other luggage - This one is easy. A saddle bag (not the old carrier type) can carry a lot of stuff safely.</li>
<li>Rains - For this, I still haven't found a good solution. I just ditch my bicycle and take my car on rainy days. Sometimes though, I have gotten unlucky and ridden in the rain.</li>
<li>Some bad drivers/riders on the road - Patience is the only solution to this problem. Every time I start cycling, I tell myself that I will ignore anyone who behaves bad on the road.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, the good things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A lot of exercise for me and it is almost free.</li>
<li>Faster commute and it is again free.</li>
<li>For the environmentally conscious, nothing can beat cycling.</li>
<li>And personally, it has taught me a lot of patience.
All I wish is that there will be dedicated cycling lanes and a little more respect for cyclists on roads. Just so that I'll find many other cyclists on roads.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a href="#367" title="2014-01-21 17:16:15">Lekha</a>:</strong> Which bike do u suggest for ladies for the same route ? Cost effective one pls</p>
<p><strong><a href="#954" title="2014-04-18 07:26:06">ashwin67</a>:</strong> For an enjoyable ride, I would suggest at least a decent alloy mountain bike with 3x8 gears. A Merida Juliet 20V or 40V would be a good bike for ladies I guess. This should cost around Rs.25000. Decathlon has some good frames for ladies as well.</p>
