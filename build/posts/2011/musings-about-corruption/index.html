<h1>Musings about corruption</h1>
<p>Who isn't corrupt? Based on what is your definition of morality, you may have a different level of gauging how corrupt the other person is. But how good are you really? And an even more important question. In this world driven by competition, is it of any use to be good and suffer?</p>
<p>We talk about corrupt politicians and businessmen and the need to change the system, How good are we? Have you never paid a bribe to save some effort on your side? Have you never paid money to a policeman, maybe to get a driver's license or a passport? Have you never shown a false receipt to claim income tax benefits? Have you never ever driven on the wrong side of the road to avoid a few kilometers? Have you never outsourced corruption to a broker at some government office?</p>
<p>We have excuses for being corrupt. The biggest one being, "the government anyway doesn't do any good with the tax I pay". Shifting the blame to a faceless body always helps one's sense of morality. Another usual excuse is "India is like this only". Again, sharing the blame with a billion people is easier on one's conscience. For every single act of corruption, we rationalize.</p>
<p>Looking at this, doesn't it seem natural that we get what we deserve? Aren't politicians just like us? They have just trained themselves better than us; Both in the act of corruption as well as in finding an excuse. Even a mafia don rationalizes himself saying that he looks afterÂ  "his people" well.</p>
<p>The above thoughts can lead one to become a pessimist: Unless I change, the system won't change and since I am not prepared to change, I don't expect the system to change.</p>
<p>I sometimes get such thoughts but then, immediately somewhere deep in my heart, I revolt against being a pessimist. I believe everyone has that feeling within them. That keeps my hope alive that things will change.</p>
