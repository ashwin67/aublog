<h1>This country needs change</h1>
<p>As act after act of terror strikes our country, it certainly feels that we are not safe anymore. Glorification of the acts by the media aggrevates the feeling. One cannot fail to notice the lapse in intelligence gathering. Misplaced priorities of the politicians makes the situation worse than it is already. A few years back (2-3 years I guess), one of the national news channels had conducted a mock act of bringing in large shipments of ammunition via sea. They had large boxes which were painted in red "explosives". They just sailed the raft undetected into a beach and showed how weakly defended the country was. Now, the whole story repeated itself claiming the life of hundreds. And a few minutes back, Headlines Today reports that "Sonia Gandhi is going to address the nation"!! Where is the prime minister? I just hope the political parties refrain themselves from starting blame games. Sure, what has happened cannot be undone. However, its time to think of everything from a long term perspective. The first right of every citizen of a country would be the right to live safely and peacefully. Now, all we need to ask is, when will we/someone start a political party that recognize the rights of peaceful people and create a proper government for the people.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#9" title="2008-11-30 13:40:53">lakshmi</a>:</strong> i know! Media glorifies the entire thing. Another thing is that the newsreaders are rattling off the number of dead sounding more excited than depressed!! "now, its 100 dead, 150...160..." it scares me.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#10" title="2008-12-01 19:01:19">Ashwini</a>:</strong> We are in such a position where we have face fear for each step... we have to hold our breath for each step we place...In our own country we are no where safe... We are facing hell lot of problem. Why our govt is failing to give the security to the commonman life..? Why we are realising ourselves as Indians when such incident occurs...?..Obviously we are Indians ..we should not need such incidents to prove ourselves... Then whom to believe..? Then whom to blame...?</p>
