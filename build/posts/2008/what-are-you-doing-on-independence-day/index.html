<h1>What are you doing on Independence day?</h1>
<p>Well, I am repeating this :) <img alt="" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRw3AqqRI/AAAAAAAAA2s/9AZCxmF562U/s400/blr_my_old.jpg" /> What does cycling from Bangalore to Mysore have to do with Independence day? Nothing :) Its just for the fun. At the least, I feel it makes much more sense than watching the <em>"Independence day special"</em> movies on Television.</p>
