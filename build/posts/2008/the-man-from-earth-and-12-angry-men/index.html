<h1>The man from Earth and 12 angry men</h1>
<p>Suppose a man you know from the last 10 years tells you that he has been living on this Earth for the past 14,000 years, how could you tell whether he is what he says, or whether he is a liar or he is a nut? How could you say that Science disproves it when new things are discovered all the time? How could you say he is crazy if he told you he created a new religion 2000 years back? You can reason, both for and against his claim. Suppose a man is convicted for murder and the case is being proved by the lawyers. Can you refute the popular verdict and still pronounce the convict <em>'not guilty'</em>? Can you say that the case was proved against the convict not because of prejudices? 2 movies I watched recently: <strong>The man from Earth</strong> and <strong>12 angry men</strong>. How these people reason!!! Like in the Matrix, anything is possible. It is just that we have to throw away our prejudices. <img alt="" src="http://www.manfromearth.com/Images/MFE-Home-Page-Background.jpg" /></p>
