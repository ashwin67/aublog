<h1>One Way :)</h1>
<p>The day started a bit early today. I pulled my bike out from its deep sleep and hit the empty roads of Mysore at 6:30 in the morning. The destination was the foot of Chamundi hills. 15 kms of zero-traffic tree-lined roads carried me back to my past. The days were always filled with anticipation. Every place I went, there used to be a tiny thought in the back of my mind. She may be somewhere out here. Every time I passed through a new road, I would think one of the houses on this road may be her home. Every time I saw her passing by, I would think that I should go and talk to her. Unfortunately, I just thought and thought and nothing more. Now I think again whether I would have been a different person if I had only acted upon my thoughts then. And then, I reached the footsteps of Chamundi hills and started climbing the 1000 steps once more.</p>
