<h1>The Event</h1>
<p>Many days back, one of my friends commented here on livehournal: "Thats really an amazing job with ultimate satisfaction i guess". I didn't think much about job satisfaction then. I was thinking more about the resulting trees out of my work. But today her comment makes so much sense. Today, we at sapgreen planted the first 2 saplings. And by doing this, we may have created "an event to remember" for 2 special people. Read the entire event here: <a href="http://sapgreen.blogspot.com/2008/03/event-to-remember.html">http://sapgreen.blogspot.com/2008/03/event-to-remember.html</a> <img alt="" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRcB8bI2I/AAAAAAAAAzE/2uWZXoh0d4I/s400/firstplant.jpg" /></p>
