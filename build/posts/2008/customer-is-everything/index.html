<h1>Customer is everything</h1>
<p>First, do read this story: <a href="http://www.zazlamarr.com/blog/?p=240">"I heart Zappos"</a>. That is what is meant by exceptional customer service. <a href="http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos</a> in their own words is a service company that happens to sell shoes and handbags and clothing and accessories and eventually anything and everything. The company grew from nothing in 1999 to a $840 million company in 2007!! All of this just by believing that customer service is not <em>one department in the company _but customer service is _the</em> <em>entire company</em>. Such an obvious way to grow yet rarely adopted among businesses. Instead of spending 20 - 40% of a company's spending budget on marketing, if it were to spend the same on the customer, wouldn't that make a difference? Zappos is the answer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#20" title="2008-12-14 17:00:57">GVK</a>:</strong> It would help if business persons could internalise the basics of customer service - promptness in service, punctuality, and proficiency. It would be a good idea if everyone/every department connected with business could pause before making any business decision to ask - would it enhance the company's customer service? If the answer is 'yes' then, only then, they should go ahead. Many companies are quick to introduce new products in market without making proper arrangement for after-sales service. Branded items sell in Mysore, whiie their customers have to depend on after-sales service from Bangalore. The companies selling them or their dealers don't consider it worthwhile having a full-fledged functioning customer service section locally( because it cuts into profit margin?). Result is their service is less than satisfactory, in terms of their response to customer call, servicing time span, and quality of service.</p>
