<h1>A Brief History of Time</h1>
<p>Today is the 9th day out of software and it still hasn't affected me in any way. I'm just having an extended holiday feeling. I was thinking 2.5 years of software immersion would make me think that "C" is oxygen and "Test-spec" is water. I was wrong. Life goes on without them although it is still early to say. The days are still hectic though. The only difference is that I plan for my "manpower", I decide the "tasks" and finally I myself fill up the "time-sheet". Writing here will now be a planned part of my everyday work. So, keep checking this page.</p>
