<h1>Making sense of the internet</h1>
<p>Now, even <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/seth">Seth Godin</a> is quite unsure about the <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/12/warning-the-int.html">internet</a>. Its become full!! No, not that there isn't enough space to fit the data. Its just that our attention is quite full. Probably the first time you used the internet, it was more about finding relevant information in the easiest way. It was about finding information even before it appeared on TV or the papers. Is it the same anymore? For example, a few years back I really got interested by the issue of climate change. I found out using the internet, everything I wanted to know about climate change. Then, I found a great deal of blogs written on climate change. Whereas earlier I read an article per day on the topic, I now get delivered into my inbox via RSS feeds, some 100 different blogs written by various famous authors around the world. Each seem to be really interesting but its impossible to find the time to even read a fraction of those. Yet, for some unknown reason, I would like to at least get a summary of those blogs. Just 10 years back, google with their superior search engine techniques made data meaningful in a utterly cluttered world wide web. I guess, something revolutionary is again required to make sense of the excessive yet "seemingly must have" information on the web.</p>
