<h1>Start early</h1>
<p>If you've got that urge to do something you think would change the world, then what are you waiting for? Do it now. Ever tried to talk about doing business at the age of 16? You would get a "How old are you? What do you know about business?". When you are 25, talk about the same. And you will get a "Do you have any experience in the field?" So, how old is old enough?</p>
