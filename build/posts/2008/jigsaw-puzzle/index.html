<h1>Jigsaw Puzzle</h1>
<p>Watching LOST sometimes gives strange insights. Especially the dialogues said by the lead characters. Desmond: "The universe has a way of.... sort of.... course correcting itself" John Locke: "Everything that happens here.... happens for a reason" John Locke: " Do not tell me what I cannot do" And as it happens in LOST, sometimes various parts of life's jigsaw puzzle fall beautifully into one single piece. And what am I talking about? Its as mysterious as LOSTÂ  :-)</p>
