<h1>Are you an explorer?</h1>
<p>The modern human didn't drop from the sky. Humans evolved. Unless the urge to find something new everyday was present, we wouldn't have the computer today. Without the urge to explore, we wouldn't have touched the surface of the moon. So, what happens when you suppress the explorer instinct? You know it all too well. Start today, explore something, start something new, innovate. You are born an explorer.</p>
