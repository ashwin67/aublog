<h1>Livejournal</h1>
<p>Since I plan to blog regularly, I thought it would be best to personalize my blog. Moreover, livejournal was not allowing me to post for the past one month. As a result, I decided to purchase my own domain, personalize the whole blog with my own template and write some serious stuff :) As I had just finished setting up the <a href="http://www.sapgreen.com/">new sapgreen site</a> and the <a href="http://www.sapgreen.com/blog">sapgreen blog</a>, setting this blog hardly took an hour. And that is including importing the entries from <a href="http://ashwin67.livejournal.com">livejournal</a> to this blog. However, I faced some problems with importing the comments from there. Anyway, that is fine I guess. I am yet to find some time to fix the layout. Will do it over a week's time.</p>
