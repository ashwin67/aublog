<h1>22 minutes of bliss</h1>
<p>Crisp air that can soothe all pains, the view of a hill behind a misty screen challenged only by the golden rays of the Sun which rises higher and higher, musical sounds as storks cut through the otherwise still waters and fresh smells of the ever growing jungle. If these are what I'd get in return for just 22 minutes of jogging, I will consider it as the most worthy investment of all. 22 minutes of nature, 22 minutes of health, 22 minutes of retrospection, 22 minutes of philosophical insight, 22 minutes of confidence, 22 minutes of patience, 22 minutes of so many things that I can only feel but don't have words to describe. Jog around "Kukkarahalli kere" on the 3.6 kilometers circular Jogging path. Feel bliss.</p>
