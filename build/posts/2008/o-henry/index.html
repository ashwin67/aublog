<h1>O Henry</h1>
<p>Once, we were a pack. Then something happened and each started off his way. Some reached distant lands. Others remained closer yet in foreign lands. Some are about to start off. And some stayed back home yet far apart. If you are confused, I am just talking about a bunch of chums who split in no time for their own good reasons. It feels like everyone is living in a different world, what with the difference not just in location but also in time. We have a deal now. The following excerpt from a story by O'Henry: "I dined here at 'Big Joe' Brady's with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers, together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn't have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well, we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come." William Sydney Porter i.e. O'Henry named his story "After Twenty years". Our story is called "After Ten years".</p>
