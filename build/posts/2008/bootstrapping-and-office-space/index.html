<h1>Bootstrapping and office space</h1>
<p>First of all, if you are not quite aware of the term bootstrapping, here's <a href="http://blogs.openforum.com/2008/11/25/the-art-of-bootstrapping/">a great explanation of the same</a>. Now, when you are bootstrapping a business, you may not be able to gauge the exact office space requirements. So, what do you do? A few innovative ideas implemented by others are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Mobile office. Example: There is this guy who tells every customer of his: "Why take the pain of coming this far, sir. I'll come to your place itself and explain everything"</li>
<li>Coffee day office. Example: Another person who used this strategy a few years back but now has grown into a big office. He used to stay at Barista or Coffee day all day. Not even inside the office. Outside it just so that he could make use of its wi-fi. When a customer had to meet him, he would give the address of that same place. Posh place. Rent charges = coffee charges. Perks: Free internet.</li>
<li>Lakes, Hill etc. Used by us sometimes for board meetings :)
Some might think that these would look cheap. However, the point is not about how others think. The point is about making the best of the opportunities in the most efficient way.</li>
