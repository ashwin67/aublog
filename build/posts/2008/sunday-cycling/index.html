Another trip.This time, we rode towards the kaveri valley. This part of the Earth is now painted green by the monsoons. Water is everywhere. The clouds act as our sun-screen. And we, the best source of renewable energy to pedal our cycles. <img alt="" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRsItkAuI/AAAAAAAAA1k/QSJFviVhmeE/s400/krscyc1.jpg" /> KrishnarajaSagar reservoir being just 15kms from the city has various approach roads. We took the nearest one to save energy. From there, we hit unknown village roads towards edmuri. The scenery is amazing even after considering the fact that we are used to seeing paddy fields and water canals. Some more off-road cycling and we were at Balmuri. Balmuri, being a man made waterfall is usually filled with tourists. However, at 8AM in the morning, the place was ours and ours alone. Started at 6AM and reached back at 11AM with much of the Sunday still remaining intact. <img alt="" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRsl1nwsI/AAAAAAAAA1s/0c7McrI31sA/s400/krscyc2.jpg" /><img alt="" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRurG2EqI/AAAAAAAAA2M/GwHCMug1XJo/s400/krscyc4.jpg" /><img alt="" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMlRv9wkRCI/AAAAAAAAA2c/MXj_-RSwaxk/s400/krscyc8.jpg" /></p>
