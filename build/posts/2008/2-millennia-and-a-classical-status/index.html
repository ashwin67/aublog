<h1>2 Millennia and a classical status</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka_rock_edict">Ashoka rock edict</a> found at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmagiri_archaeological_site">Brahmagiri</a> (dated to 230 BC) has been suggested to contain a word in identifiable Kannada. The earliest examples of a full-length Kannada language stone inscription (<em>shilashaasana</em>) containing Brahmi characters with characteristics resembling those of Tamil in <em>Hale Kannada</em> script can be found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halmidi_inscription">Halmidi inscription</a>, dated 450 CE, indicating that Kannada had become an administrative language by this time. <a href="http://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಕನ್ನಡ">http://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/ಕನ್ನಡ</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada_language</a> The earliest epigraphic records found date from around the third century BCE and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tholkappiyam">Tolkāppiyam</a>, the oldest known treatise in Tamil, has been dated variously between 2nd century BCE and 10th century CE. <a href="http://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/தமிழ்">http://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/தமிழ்</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language</a> The Languages which saw more than 2 Millennia pass by, are now in a fight for "classical status". What would that status supposedly do? Enrich the language or take language across boundaries like how Purandaradasa or Muthuswami Dikshitar or Thyagaraja did? Tamil is officially declared as a classical language of India. Kannada and Telugu were about to be accorded the same status. Kaboom!!! A Public Interest Litigation is filed against this. I don't know how any person would find happiness in doing this. <a href="http://www.zeenews.com/articles.asp?aid=461197&amp;sid=REG">Anyways, this is just more fodder for our KRV guys to disrupt public life.</a></p>
