<h1>Solving the wrong problem</h1>
<p>"What is the opposite of happiness? Sadness?  No.  Just as love and hate are two sides of the same coin, so are happiness and sadness.  Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this.  The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is - here's the clincher - boredom." -Timothy Ferris, _ Four-Hour Workweek_ The point is that you may be solving a wrong problem <img alt="" src="http://cestelena.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/wrong-problem.jpg" /></p>
