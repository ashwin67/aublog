<h1>A lesson learnt !!</h1>
<p>For a novice in business like me, not having a mentor would have meant losing a business on a future date. Failure to keep your word can bring negative thoughts about you in the customer's mind. A fulfilled promise may or may not bring you more business but a failed one can make your business bankrupt. And what is a promise? Even a tiny thing such as "I will try to call you tomorrow". You may have said "try" but the person at the other end may have prepared a lot in anticipation of your call and he may not like that preparation wasted. I always heard people talk about godfathers, mentors, icons and people who influenced them. For the first time, I found a mentor who is amazing in more ways than one. I thought I was very energetic but I was wrong. This guy is 3<strong>.</strong>04 times my age and atleast 304 times more energetic than me !!</p>
