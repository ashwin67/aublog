<h1>After a busy week...</h1>
<p>One thought after the end of a week is: "It feels strange not to be paid immediately for working so hard". Anyway, this was a choice I knowingly made. Yet, it feels so strange, it can only be experienced. If anyone needs a business idea, then you just need to get out of your home. For example, I needed to get a business card printed and had a few ideas about it. First of all, I needed textured paper and not the usual stuff cards are made out of. Second, my logo has a color gradient in it. Now, it seems most of the printers here in Mysore cannot satisfy both the requirements simultaneously. Offset printers provide all types of paper but they cannot print gradients. Digital printers do the opposite. So, I started to google for online printers. The online printers only provide photo solutions. Nobody provides business cards, brochures and other office related stuff. Not all offices can afford as much time as we did. The only solution people with less time do is they compromise about quality. If there is someone providing quality with convenience, then that someone would definitely do great business. Think about it. The online printing business is a great opportunity waiting to be exploited. Other than that, I found that google is continuing to create amazing stuff. Google reader is one product to which got hooked to this week. Although this is there since a long time, I only found now that it has the amazing features it has. And Orkut will shortly have gadgets inside it which users can share and I found that the apps are pretty easy to create provided you know some programming, html, java and xml. Apps were always present in igoogle. Now, there will be a programming frenzy in the orkut community. Developers can see what it is even now through sandbox. Others though will have to wait till end of February.</p>
