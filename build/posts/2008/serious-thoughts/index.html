<h1>Serious thoughts</h1>
<p>Some vague thoughts moving around my head. Probably the below lines may not make any sense to anyone reading this. Somehow, these have affected me way too much. <img alt="" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMqLPWHkiLI/AAAAAAAAA3o/qLpsR8ZeTDE/s144/thoughts2.jpg" /><img alt="" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMqLPd91SxI/AAAAAAAAA3g/lt-OxcSGI_s/s144/thoughts1.jpg" /><img alt="" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMqLPhFmJ9I/AAAAAAAAA3w/qUxyXXpl0Us/s144/thoughts3.jpg" /><img alt="" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMqLPnvHJrI/AAAAAAAAA34/Iy7sjrIJZR0/s144/thoughts4.jpg" /><img alt="" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/ashwin67/SMqLPj_3bTI/AAAAAAAAA4A/ULzverOTX0M/s144/thoughts5.jpg" /> Either there is something in common between all of these or may be I am finding a connection. The real life example for "life" would be Baba Amte who once said: "Where there is fear, there is no love. Where there is no love, there is no God ... That is why I took up leprosy work. Not to help anyone, but to overcome that fear in my life. That it worked out good for others was a by-product. But the fact is I did it to overcome fear". Defeat fear. Live life. Life is something which I feel is best explained only by Ayn Rand: "There's something I would like to understand.And I don't think anyone can explain it...There's your life.You begin it,feeling that it's something so precious and rare,so beautiful that it's like a sacred treasure.Now it's over,and it doesn't make any difference to anyone, and it isn't that they are indifferent, it's just that they don't know what it means,that treasure of mine, and there's some thing bout it that they should understand.I don't understand it myself,but there is something about it that should be understood by all of us.Only what is it? what ?". These are the words of a young girl who is sentenced to imprisonment in Siberia under the Russian communist rule only for failure to live according to the wishes of the state.</p>
