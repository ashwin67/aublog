<h1>How to stay busy</h1>
<p>Here's my list: </p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a guitar. Then, visit <a href="http://www.justinguitar.com/">JustinGuitar.com</a>. With the amount of knowledge at that site, you could well become a pro.</li>
<li>Write a blog. It hardly takes 10 minutes to setup a blog. I'd say <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> is the best looking blog site.</li>
<li>Buy a cycle. Go <a href="/blog/2008/to-live">long distance cycling</a>.</li>
<li>Just run. No accessories required. Just a pair of legs. For the sake of a target, you could actually <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7U4VkUtnEzymVwUJK8pvTQ">practice for a marathon</a>.</li>
<li>Trek. Again, all you need is a pair of legs.</li>
<li>Build your own website like this one. Or maybe like <a href="http://www.sapgreen.com/">this one</a>.</li>
<li>Read a book like this one: <a href="http://www.stayhungrybook.com/">Stay hungry, Stay foolish</a>. This will give you even more ideas to make something out of your life.</li>
<li>Start a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/tag/type:id/category:green/">DIY project</a>.</li>
<li>Write code for open source projects. Maybe, for a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">wordpress plugin</a>.</li>
<li>Buy a camera.</li>
<li>Plant a tree and look after it. This IMO gives the most happiness of all.</li>
<li>And the best of all. Start a company :)
And yes, from experience I can say that all of them can be done at the same time as well</li>
</ol>
