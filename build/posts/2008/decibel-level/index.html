<h1>Decibel level</h1>
<p>A casual remark or a casual discussion sometimes turns into a high temper, high volume debate. Egos clash and nothing remains in control. I try hard and then intentionally fall silent every time the volume of a discussion crosses a certain decibel, no matter the opposition's stance. However, I'm not really sure if this is a right approach. Maybe, a continuation of the discussion at the same level would have been fruitful! Something to think about.</p>
