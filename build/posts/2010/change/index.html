<p>Wish you a year of <em>change</em> and a great decade ahead!</p>
<p>Replace <em>change</em> with <em>happiness</em>. In my experience, change means happiness. Some of the major changes I did to me in the past 2 years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Planted more than 500 trees with the help of a lot of well-wishers (and had to stop doing this too!).</li>
<li>Started a business with 2 friends and failed in that (learnt a lot of lessons in the process).</li>
<li>Started another business with same friends and seeing a lot of hope in this (understood the importance of persistence).</li>
<li>Started networking with people (something in which I was really bad at).</li>
<li>Started teaching occasionally at a school to 7th standard kids (learning that education systems really need reforms).</li>
<li>Started blogging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each one of them has been a life changing experience. Each one of them was a really tough thing to start. Change is always like that. I hope this year would bring more such changes; to me and to you. I'd really want more people to come out of their comfort levels and make a change to themselves and in the process, to the world too.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#112" title="2010-01-02 06:12:36">G V Krishnan</a>:</strong> Well said, Anil. 'Hope','life' and 'change' are interrelated. I guess the driving force for Ashwin's life-altering changes is hope.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#113" title="2010-01-09 21:21:00">Ashwini</a>:</strong> Good Repely sir(@g v krishnan)....That driving force should be there to come up with some innovative ideas....We will wish him all success throughout his life....</p>
