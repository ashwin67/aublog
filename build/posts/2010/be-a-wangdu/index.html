<h1>Be a Wangdu!</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rajesh-hanbal.blogspot.com/">Rajesh Hanbal</a> used to work at a reputed software firm in Bangalore. He has quit his job and is dedicated towards preparations for the Indian Administrative Service.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ashwinkrishna.info">Ashwin Krishna</a> also used to work at a software firm in Bangalore. He has quit to achieve his dreams. His aim is to create a world-class university.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.royalmysorewalks.com/">Vinay Parameswarappa</a>, another ex-software engineer conducts walk tours in Mysore and gives you an experience of true places which are not in any map.</li>
<li>Rakshit plans to quit his software job and get into music production.</li>
<li>Prashanth is director at an <a href="http://informedia.co.in/">internet solution company</a>.</li>
<li>Justin is an American who is passionate about Mysore and works hard to make civic problems known.</li>
<li>Sourabh, again an ex-software engineer runs a <a href="http://www.vayam.in/">book club and is into event management</a>.</li>
<li>Suraj and Anil and I run a company into renewable energy power plants (1).</li>
</ul>
<p>I had written about <a href="/blog/2010/spread-that-idea">Mysore Santhe in my last post</a>. That is where I met many of the people I mentioned now. We had many more people like GV Krishnan (2), Krishnavattam, Bapu Sathyanarayana, ER Ramachandran and Javeed Nayeem who write for the print media and Anantaramaiah who runs a school in Mysore.</p>
<p>I guess you liked <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phunsuk-Wangdu-Aamir-Khan/243793506128">Phunsuk Wangdu</a> on screen. Mysore Santhe is a place to meet such Wangdus. And probably get inspired enough to become a Wangdu yourself.</p>

<li>Added this line after comments from readers</li>
<li>It was G V Krishnan who initiated this idea of Mysore Santhe</li>

You will meet him in the next meet. Also, tell as many people as possible to attend. It is as much yours as it is ours :)
