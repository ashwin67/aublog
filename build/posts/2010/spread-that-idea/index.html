<h1>Spread that Idea!</h1>
<p>Imagine a place where artists, entrepreneurs, engineers, journalists and people from various streams come together with just one agenda: To let ideas flow. That is the kind of place we want "<strong>Mysore Santhe</strong>" to be. And for it to be a success, you need to be there too. Just walk into <strong>Samvaada vana at Yuvaraja campus, Mysore</strong> on <strong>any Sunday</strong> anytime between <strong>11AM and 1PM</strong>. The first one will be on 10th January, 2010.</p>
<p>The initial plan was to create something similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speakers'_Corner">speaker's corner (in Hyde park, London)</a> or may be something similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Coffee_House#Coffee_House_at_College_Street">Coffee house at college street</a> or may be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin_Round_Table">Algonquin round table</a>. However, there are no set rules as to how Mysore santhe should evolve. The place belongs to you, the visitors to this place and it may become anything that you want it to be.</p>
