<h1>Report on Mysore Santhe</h1>
<p>Mysore Santhe started on January 10th, 2010 as an informal gathering of people who do not necessarily have anything in common. To know it better, be at the <strong>Rangayana open theater this Sunday any time between 11AM and 1PM</strong> (earlier held in Samvaada vana, Yuvaraja college). (See <a href="/blog/2010/be-a-wangdu">here for an earlier post</a>). It is amazing to see how 7 Sundays can create many new things or at least ignite new ideas. Here is a list of some of the outcomes from my perspective:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mysore Chitrasanthe/Kalasanthe - A fixed location in Mysore would host artists of all kinds on a weekly basis. Being a weekly, it has the potential of creating a cultural change. (I had blogged this <a href="/blog/2010/chitrasanthe-mysore">earlier here</a>).</li>
<li>Startuppers: A sub-network of entrepreneurs/wannabe-entrepreneurs was formed and this has resulted in a great deal of motivation for ourselves.</li>
<li>An Events calendar: Mysore being a tourist destination and a place with daily cultural activities still does not provide updated information on the events to visiting tourists. A weekly product such as this should be of great value to tourists and could be a good sell at the hotels and restaurants of Mysore.</li>
<li>The Mysore Santhe idea itself: Is instrumental in helping many of us meet interesting people whom we otherwise wouldn't have possibly met.</li>
</ol>
<p>From my experience, not all ideas necessarily succeed. Yet, the higher the number of ideas, higher the chance of at least a few of them succeeding. This is where Mysore Santhe is making the difference. Apart from creating ideas, the other great advantage of such a gathering is the spreading of information. Another list on interesting initiatives here:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.divyadeepatrust.org/">Divyadeepa Trust</a>: Started in 1992 with a mission of providing value based quality education to rural and underprivileged children. Many of the Santhe enthusiasts are active volunteers at Divyadeepa.</li>
<li><a href="http://mygrapa.blogspot.com/">Mysore Grahakara Parishat</a>: I think everyone in Mysore knows about this organization. It is an organization into consumer, civic, environmental activism among others. Some of the Santhe enthusiasts are active volunteers at MGP.</li>
<li>Kukkarahalli nature walk: This is a free walk around Kukkarahalli lake conducted on the first Sunday of every month (7AM) by environmentalists, professional bird-watchers etc. Although I am yet to attend one of these, it seems to me like an interesting walk.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.royalmysorewalks.com/">Royal Mysore Walks</a>: Walk tours in Mysore by Vinay. This week, I am going on an invitational walk with him. I will write more on this after that.</li>
</ol>
<p>I definitely have missed many more initiatives here which we come across at Mysore Santhe. Every time I have been there, I have found at least one new and innovative idea/initiative at the Santhe.</p>
<p>Above all, the event is more about the people. If you want to learn from others' experiences and others' mistakes, these are the kind of gatherings you want to be.</p>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p><strong><a href="#149" title="2010-02-25 12:01:01">Ashwin Krishna</a>:</strong> To add on 1&gt; Enlen(http://enlen.in/), founded by dearest santhe family members. At the time of "chaos at Copenhagen", a small startup constantly working on green tech with an aim to make this world a better place. 2&gt; Sapgreen(http://sapgreen.com) a brilliant idea of greening our earth. I really wish the vision of Billion Trees will achieved. 3&gt; TEDxMysore. We are still in the planning phase. Hope things will fly :)</p>
<p><strong><a href="#150" title="2010-02-25 17:25:18">GVK</a>:</strong> I posted this comment on facebook; and wish to flog it here as well. That the founding five of this initiative comprise two youths and three oldies goes to show that the generation gap isn't unbridgeable. For someone pushing 70s I had not had a chance to interact with so many youngsters as I have had in the last seven Sundays. Speaking of the generational divide I read somewhere - "The younger we are, the more we want to change the world; the older we get, the more we want to change the young". I don't know who said this. Whoever did, presumably, was in on the santhe discussions.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#151" title="2010-02-25 19:43:07">Vasanthkumar Mysoremath</a>:</strong> Dear All, I had heard of Hyde Park of London where anybody concerned about any subject can go and vent their ire or concern or complaint or talk about what affects our life. Now I am happy to find that Mysore Santhe is similar to that and I will be there on 28th. Mr.GVK has also invited me and hope he will not 'flog' me. I am a member of MGP and will be happy to air my concerns about our dear Heritage City of Mysore. Those who are internet savvy can browse http://mysorenext.com where one can find many of my postings in Overheard Section on the home page with photographs... invariably starting with the words "What an underbridge..." etc. Santhe friends can browse my above website and come up with questions related to the subject of saving of electricity without intervention of nano technology or million dollar investment. World Bank had honored me... that is another story. Vasanthkumar Mysoremath 9845950440</p>
