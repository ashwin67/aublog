<h1>Autobiography</h1>
<p>I have been watching a lot of TED-Talks lately and every time I watch one, I ask myself one question. Is my life as varied as theirs?</p>
<p>The more I think about that question, the more I get the feeling that I should record my past 25 years in paper.  Probably, 25 years is  too short a time to actually have that many varied experiences. If that is the case, then this autobiography should at least help me create more such experiences in my future life.</p>
<p>I think I will do something worth being on the same stage as the speakers at TED in the next 20-25 years. And when that happens, this book would definitely be worth the effort as I do not have that much belief on my memory.</p>
<p>Hmm, that was an extremely optimistic post! Hope!</p>
<p>PS: Personal deadline for finishing this book - 30th Jan 2010.</p>
<p>Update(29th Jan 2010): No easy job. This requires one more year!</p>
