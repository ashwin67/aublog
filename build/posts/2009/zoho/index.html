<h1>Zoho</h1>
<p>Well, I am in no way connected to the marketing department at Zoho. But I just can't help marketing this product. Try <a href="http://www.zoho.com/">Zoho</a> :) If you are worried about managing stuff, whether it is time, money or an entire organization, you should try this site. You get time management tools, project management tools, document editors, presentation tools, customer relationship management, meeting tool and all sorts of business tools integrated into one. A large organization may have the resources to invest in ERP tools such as SAP. But who needs SAP when you have Zoho? What is even better is that you get to try all these features for free. Upgrade it only when you require an upgrade. Even more interesting is their commitment to their customers. Just have a look at the <a href="http://www.zoho.com/company.html">about us</a> page. Even better proof is their forum where they practically solve every customer query in a matter of days. Just amazing. Love you Zoho.</p>
