<h1>The pace of development!!!</h1>
<p>The pace at which bangalore city grows can be best seen from the sky.</p>
<p>The satellite picture on the left seems to be taken between 2000 and 2003. The picture on the right is sometime after 2006. The region shown below is about 15kms from bangalore center.</p>

<p>Large tracts of greenery have been replaced by concrete. Many lakes seem to have disappeared too.</p>

<p>Interestingly however, I found this particular lake being cleaned up. A recreational center also seems to be put in place by the side of the lake.<br />
