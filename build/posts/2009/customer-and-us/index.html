<h1>Customer and Us</h1>
<p><em>A customer is the most important visitor on our premises. He is not dependent on us. We are dependent on him. He is not an interruption in our work - he is the purpose of it. We are not doing him a favour by serving him. He is doing us a favour by giving us the opportunity to serve him. - Mahatma Gandhi</em> Every discovery seems so obvious once it is discovered. Same goes with thoughts such as above. They seem so obvious once they are said. Aren't they?</p>
