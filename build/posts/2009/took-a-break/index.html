<h1>Took a break</h1>
<p>I just did a reboot by not blogging for 3 weeks and it feels fresh. Extrapolating this to other forms of communication, does it help if</p>
<ul>
<li>you stay away from the mobile phone for a day?</li>
<li>you stay away from the Internet for a couple of days?</li>
<li>you refrain from talking entirely for a day? (A bit extreme may be)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I think there is some benefit at least to the creative section of the mind because of doing this. Probably that is why, poets and artists prefer solitude.</p>
