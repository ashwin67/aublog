<h1>Special Economic Zone</h1>
<p><img alt="Preamble of India" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Constitution_of_India.jpg" />The preamble of the constitution of India talks of "Equality of status and opportunity". How then does a company within a government declared "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Economic_Zone">special economic zone (SEZ)</a>" enjoy higher privileges over a company outside such a zone? SEZs were an example set by China. Emulating the same in a democratic country just leaves me puzzled. Each line of the preamble seems to have been disregarded. For example, JUSTICE, social,economic and political: Entire villages have been taken over by governments without regards to the people who lived there. Exporters outside SEZs are losing out in competition with those inside SEZs. Village Panchayats which were considered as the pillars of the nation no more have a say with respect to SEZs. I had read somewhere: <em>Shortcuts cut short your life.</em> This sure seems like one. And I am not sure whose life this is going to cut short. As a last note, studies suggest that what contributes to greater growth is a greater scale of liberalization, rather than increasing the number of SEZs. The whole country should be moving towards a liberal regime rather than creating a country within a country.</p>
