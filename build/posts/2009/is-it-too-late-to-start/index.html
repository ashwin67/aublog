<h1>Is it too late to start?</h1>
<p>Once in a while, you come across stories of ultra successful people. When you see their track record, it seems like they were born with success. But were they really much different from you when they started off? Consider these example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until he was 31 years old, he wasn't even sure what he would become. He wasn't even able to pay for movies he watched with his girlfriend. Didn't earn and yet he wanted to marry her. He planned to be a communist politician and open orphanages. Narayan Murthy ended up founding infosys at the age of 35. </li>
<li>He used alcohol, marijuana and cocaine during his teenage years. Until he was 24, he was a normal office goer at a big corporation. He did community work until he joined Harvard law schoolÂ  at the age of 27. Barack Obama, president of united states.</li>
<li>He lied about his age to get a job as an ambulance driver. He became a salesman when he was 20 and remained so until he was 35 years old. Then, he bought marketing rights for a mixer and went on selling mixers for another 17 years. At the age of 52, Ray Kroc bought a small chain of restaurants and turned it into McDonald's as we know now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only in retrospect do we really see that they had all the qualities of greatness in them. During their own lifetimes before they tasted success, I am sure no one would have appreciated their efforts. They were not geniuses. They just persevered as non-geniuses and finally became overnight wonders. Its never too late to start because, in retrospect the date on which you started fades in comparison to the success you may achieve.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#48" title="2009-05-29 09:50:24">ashwin</a>:</strong> Wow. Never knew about Colonel Harland Sanders. Read the Wikipedia article and now he's my favourite too. :) Now it makes sense why his cartoon illustration can be seen all over the world.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#49" title="2009-07-11 21:54:29">Ashwin</a>:</strong> Very thought provocative... Dr. V started Aravind Eye Hospital in his late 50's. Now Aravind is regarded as the best eye care center in world. Aravind has treated over 2.4 million poor Indians and the dream of Dr.V to eradicate blindness in India will be realized one day. He is one of the role models who even come in my dreams. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govindappa_Venkataswamy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aravind_Eye_Hospital</p>
