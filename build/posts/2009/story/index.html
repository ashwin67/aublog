<h1>Story</h1>
<p>We all love stories. <a href="http://sivers.org/drama">Kurt Vonnegut explained this beautifully (as written by Derek Sivers)</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People have been hearing fantastic stories since time began. The problem is, they think life is supposed to be like the stories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't it then obvious why we are always impressed by brands which have a story. The Infosys brand has a story. The Reliance brand has a story. The fisherman's son who becomes president of India captures our attention. A black president of the US impresses us even more.</p>
<p>This becomes all the more important when you are marketing or selling something. If your product doesn't have a story, you are just explaining the product. People do not want explanations. People want stories. In a world where everyone is marketing one or the other thing, the ones with a story win. The employee with an average technical knowledge but with a great story telling capacity gets promoted faster. The product with the same features as its competition but with great looks sells more.</p>
<p>If you don't have a story yet, then it's time you create one.</p>
