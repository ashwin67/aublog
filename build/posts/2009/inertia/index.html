<h1>Inertia</h1>
<p>If you are in the habit of sleeping in the morning till 8AM, you would definitely know the difficulty in getting up early for that early morning train. Get hold of some video game for some days and you just can't let it go. Work at your cubicle for 12-14 hours a day and you just can't let go off that habit. We all have inertia, the tendency to remain in the same state as we are in now.</p>
<p>So, what happens when change is the norm? As an entrepreneur, I face this too often. Till yesterday, I'd never have met a particular kind of customer. Today, I'll have to overcome inertia. Till yesterday, I'd never have visited a village government office. Now, I have to visit one. Never addressed public meetings, now have to. Not just people. Technology, devices, means and situations all keep changing.</p>
<p>However, I have a thought on this. When change itself becomes routine, wouldn't inertia automatically disappear? I think that is what usually happens with seasoned entrepreneurs.</p>
