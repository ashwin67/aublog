<h1>Follow the truth</h1>
<p>I've been watching construction workers since a few days now. One thing I have seen in them is that they never complain about their work. They do the same thing day after day, yet they do not complain. I have asked them in many ways whether they are happy with their work. It seems, they have understood their limitations and that things will not change by complaining. They know what they are supposed to do and they do it with full heart.</p>
<p>I have seen the same with farmers. They seem to be so content with what they have. Again it seems to me, they have understood that things are not going to change by just talking against what they do.</p>
<p>I think that is one of the keys to do your business in the best possible way. Say you have signed up for a sales job. Now, the truth is that you are supposed to sell and not keep complaining about market conditions or customer psychology or anything else that is not in your control. If you still want to complain, you would be better off instead by signing up for a job other than selling. Same goes with anything you signed up for; a software coding job, a new business you started or a post graduation course. </p>
<p>Once you have signed up for something, that becomes the truth until you resign from it. There is no use acting like you are someone else. There is no use complaining either. If you know you are better, your only option is to quit and do the better thing immediately. Otherwise, you are just wasting time.</p>
