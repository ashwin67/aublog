<h1>Writing</h1>
<p>When I worked at my previous company, my manager used to tell me "Be very careful when you put something in black and white". The reasoning was that, things you write weigh heavily as compared to what you say. Write an autobiography and you will be judged about your every move thereafter. Nobody has the same beliefs all through their life. You change some beliefs as you learn the truth about certain things. However, once you put something in writing, it generally shows that you have subscribed to the view that you wrote. 10 years later, if you change that view, you may be perceived a hypocrite or an inconsistent person. Because of this fear, many refrain from writing or expressing a view on a subject. So, should you or should you not write your thoughts? I have realized one thing. Writing your thoughts in public creates a kind of psychological state where you become committed to certain things you believe in. My sister, an art student <a href="http://www.aashitha.com/">started a blog</a> where she uploads pictures of her drawings. Now she says that she has to draw more because of the blog. You might have seen a few blog posts elsewhere saying "Its been a while since I have updated my blog"; this is visible indication of the kind of pressure I am talking. Think about it. You might want to consider starting a blog.</p>
