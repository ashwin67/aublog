<h1>Getting organized</h1>
<p>Working at large organizations is really depressing sometimes. The numerous checklists, policies and timesheets tend to reduce the employee into a robot. At least, that is the employee point of view. But aren't they present because of a reason? The methods used may be flawed but the reason in most cases would be very valid. The reasons for the existence of such 'overheads' may be the only reason why an organization has managed to grow.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="http://www.mtrfoods.com/">MTR Foods</a>. The company started as a small restaurant in 1924. Due to the recipe, it was a pretty famous hotel even in those days. However, an European tour by its owner in 1950 led to quality standards being introduced. He made it a policy that quality shouldn't be compromised in any circumstance. Whereas most restaurants in those days kept the kitchen as hidden as possible from customers, MTR showed off its kitchen as an exhibit. Whereas most restaurant try to stay open all day, MTR opens up only during specified hours of the day! Policy. Tokens are issued to customers and food is served according to the token number! Not seen in any other restaurant. The hotel is almost a tourist destination at Bangalore these days. But the real outcome of such organizational activities was that the hotel diversified into a 200 crore food product company by 2006. Of course, quality might have been an important factor here. But unless quality is institutionalized, it is impossible to maintain it for such long periods. 80+ years in this case.</p>
<p>Organizing things reduces the options sometimes. However if done neatly, then less options is much better than too many.</p>

<p><strong><a href="#34" title="2009-03-08 19:41:28">Abhilash</a>:</strong> Completely agree! I think even as a startup, one has to setup a lot of processes (read: mild overheads) as the team size starts growing. It is essential to scale.</p>
