<h1>Mahadevpura Cycling</h1>
<p>Situated about 20kms from Mysore, this is pretty easy cycling and also the traffic is very low. We went to this place 3rd October 2008 and the Sun was out in full force. Took us about 1.5 hours while going there in the morning. However, while coming back, the Sun slowed us down to 2.5 hours. <img alt="" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_TuZ4YYywUxo/Sit4fuE-HII/AAAAAAAABR8/7iUNL6c7PmU/s288/DSC00361.JPG" /><img alt="" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_TuZ4YYywUxo/Sit4fvN1GnI/AAAAAAAABSA/ndrTpW6yuqs/s288/DSC00370.JPG" /> The place is almost empty with no tourists in sight. One reason to the low number of tourists is that Mahadevpura is a vast area and the river Kaveri flows very wide here. They say, the place is full of birds if you go in the months of February to May. <img alt="" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TuZ4YYywUxo/Sit4f5hKZoI/AAAAAAAABSE/9p6IId0KIqE/s288/DSC00378.JPG" /><img alt="" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_TuZ4YYywUxo/Sit4f4YquyI/AAAAAAAABSI/T6jpOOzAEic/s288/DSC00382.JPG" /></p>
