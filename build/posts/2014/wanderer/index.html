<h1>Wanderer!</h1>
<p>Why can't I be there again?</p>
<p>Where only the sun woke us up, The peaks showed us the way, The sight of people cheered us.</p>
<p>Where life was simple, There was happiness in the smile of an old man, There was satisfaction in the face of every traveller.</p>
<p>Where the road ahead was always unknown, The days were always difficult but never impossible, The goal was never bigger than the journey.</p>
<p>Or maybe I do not have to go anywhere Maybe it is not about the place itself. Isn't this all in the wanderer's mind?</p>
